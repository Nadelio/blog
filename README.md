# Hey look, just another blog!
Hi, it's me! I'm Connor, or Nadelio. Idk, call me what you want.\
\
Anyways, I'm making this blog as a outlet for my ramblings, so that I am generally not pestering fellow PL devs in the PLTDI Discord Server :P\
I typically ramble about various CS Theory things, PL dev, OS dev, conlangs, and my ePU project.\
So expect that kind of thing here, I don't have much else planned for this blog yet, idk maybe I'll post some other random projects of mine?\
Anyways, go forth! Look upon my empty blog and smile as I proceed to barely post! :3
